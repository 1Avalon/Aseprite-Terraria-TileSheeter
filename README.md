# tAsepriteSheeter
a basic Aseprite script to convert a sprite into a Terraria tilesheet

## How to use?

Every individual tile has a size of 16x16 pixels. The script currently only works when you're using a size of 8x8 pixel per tile (prefered anyway to avoid Mixels).
The script will upscale the sprite to fit the Terraria resolution afterwards.
